# Image Colorizatiom Using Panoptic Segmentation and Style Transfer
Hello! We're Amanda Tong and Omkar Ghenand, and welcome to the Github repository for our 6.819 (Advances in Computer Vision) Final Project. For this project, we chose the Image Colorization topic. Most recently, image colorization methods have involved convolutional neural network architectures (such as those of Zhang et al.). In our approach, we combine two areas of Computer Vision research to colorize images: Image Segmentation and Style Transfer.
